I'm heading out in about a week for a 90-mile loop in Great Smoky Mountain
National Park. I'll be walking the northern half of the AT in the park, more or
less, and then returning on the Benton MacKaye. As I've been thinking through
gear and food for the trip, I thought it'd be useful for future me to document
some the decisions. First up, my plan for breakfasts. I'm a creature of habit
off the trail when it comes to breakfast, and this is an adaption of what I eat
most days, only fixed for the trail.

| 70g Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli (280 cal.)
| 1 tbsp PB2 Powdered Almond Butter (25 cal.)
| 1 tbsp chia seeds (60 cal.)
| Trader Joe's freeze dried fruit (strawberry, raspberry, and/or blueberry) (negligible)
| optional -- 1 tbsp TJ's Roasted Cocoa Nibs (50 cal.)
| optional -- nuts (can be quite a bit if you need it.)



Put these ingredients in a Stand and Fill Ziploc Slider. On trail, just add
a few ounces of water, give it a good shake, and let it sit for a bit for the
almond powder, chia, and muesli to hydrate. Can be done the night before, or
in the morning. This kind of replicates using almond milk. I really can't stand the
flavor of powdered milk.

So, the caloric total is a minimum of 365c for 90g of food, or 4.05
calories/gram. Add the cocoa nibs, and its 415c for 98g of food, which bumps us
to 4.23 calories/gram.
